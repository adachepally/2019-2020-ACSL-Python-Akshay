Given an array of ints length 3, <br />
return an array with the elements <br />
"rotated left" so {1, 2, 3} yields {2, 3, 1}.<br />
Sample input and expected output <br />

<code>
rotate_left3([1, 2, 3]) → [2, 3, 1] <br />
rotate_left3([5, 11, 9]) → [11, 9, 5] <br />
rotate_left3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]
</code>

Once you are done push your code to github and let me know <br />
